* Most Important
** TODO fix dirvish directory preview
Some issue with insert-directory-program and switches

* Important but need actual laptop to test
** TODO yabai consistency issues
Does it work well
- is emacs /always/ tiled (it is only usually tiled in VM, but yabai is very slow to make changes in VM)
- https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/86
- https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/587

** TODO Multi-monitor support
For yabai "displays have separate spaces must be enabled".  Some workaround will be necessary
- e.g. keybinding that changes displays also moves all spaces or at least space to focus
- https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/1679
- dashboard in overlay setting

** TODO find key for printscreen

** TODO Install kitty/wezterm through nix?
Is nixgl needed?
Is it a good idea?

** TODO What happens when yabai sa fails?
Does yabai still start correctly?

* Very Nice
** TODO Basic Appearance
*** sketchybar
*** Fewer title bars
Application-specific on mac
- https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/241
- https://github.com/w0lfschild/winBuddy/issues/34

* Nice
** TODO try programs
- https://github.com/leits/MeetingBar
- https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12
 or caffeine or keeping you awak
- https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyVim (libvim not neovim)

** TODO osx optimizer
https://github.com/sickcodes/osx-optimizer
- not all of this is relevant or a good idea

** TODO Notification keybindings?
- need to find some up-to-date applescript for clearing and pulling up notification center

** TODO Fix projectile directory discovery
unfortunately this adds everything even if not project
(setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/src" ("~/src" . 1)))
(setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/" "~/src" ("~/src" . 1)))
(setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/" "~/src"
                                       ("~/src" . 1)
                                       ("~/src" . 2)))

** WAITING Kanata
- key to enable (e.g. off by default), disable, and restart
- home row modifiers due to lack of thumbkeys?

** MAYBE Basic hammerspoon dropdown script
- just max with yabai

* Not Vital (and some possibly already fixed)
** MAYBE Redshift equivalent
Just use builtin?  Can configure through nix darwin?

** MAYBE ranger setup
Start with just dirvish

** TODO Warpd and click script
Just pull click script as-is?

** TODO Playerctl daemon setup

** TODO Fix macfuse
** TODO OSX -> macOS
** TODO Change Emacs icon
** VERIFY company shell freezing bash
** TODO Fix vale recipe reference

** TODO tridactyl pywal theme
Would be much easier if import was supported so don't need custom vfox script to start firefo
